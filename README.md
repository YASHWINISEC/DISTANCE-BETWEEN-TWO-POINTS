# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import the function math
### Step 2: 
Get the list from the user
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
print the program using distance formula
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```
import math
list1=[10,6]
list2=[4,2]
distance=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```


### OUTPUT:
